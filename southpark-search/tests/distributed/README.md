## Terraform for setting up cloud infrastructure

Configure AWS provider for Terraform as per README:
https://github.com/jina-ai/cloud-ops

The terraform script here spins up AWS resources, this is the output of running
`terraform apply`:

```
data.aws_iam_policy_document.assume_role_policy: Refreshing state...

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
 <= read (data resources)

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # data.aws_subnet_ids.default will be read during apply
  # (config refers to values not yet known)

Warning: Interpolation-only expressions are deprecated

  on terraform.tf line 42, in data "aws_subnet_ids" "default":
  42:   vpc_id = "${aws_default_vpc.default_vpc.id}"

Terraform 0.11 and earlier required all non-constant expressions to be
provided via interpolation syntax, but this pattern is now deprecated. To
silence this warning, remove the "${ sequence from the start and the }"
sequence from the end of this expression, leaving just the inner expression.

Template interpolation syntax is still used to construct strings from
expressions when the template includes multiple interpolation sequences or a
mixture of literal strings and interpolations. This deprecation applies only
to templates that consist entirely of a single interpolation sequence.
